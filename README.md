# Game Prototype  

A game prototype I made to learn Three.js and javascript better in general.  If I recall, this was mostly to learn how to program an OOP app in js.

## Run  

Open explore.html

## Tech  

I made my how physics and event system.  I had no idea what I was doing but it kindof works! if objects colide they sortof compare each others' velocity and "push off" from one another. 

(If you let the zombies pile up, there is some interesting overlap)
